# IndexTestingCheck

Due to conversations that have come up the week of March 26, OGAC has returned to the 30% threshold share of Index Testing that was mentioned during RPM.

This project looks at how countries stand in comparison to that threshold. 

The data relies on "final" Data Packs that were submitted at the end of RPM. The script parses the Allocation by SNUxIM tab, pulling out all testing modality data. The focus, however, is only on Index Testing (both Index and IndexMod).
